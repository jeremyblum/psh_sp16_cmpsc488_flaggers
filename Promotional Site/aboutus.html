                I am finishing up my degree in Computer Science in the end of this semester. This project was very rewarding for me
                and I hope it can inspire others to follow this path by giving them an enjoyable method to practice their abilities 
                through this Bot!Battle! system.  I plan to pursue a career in software development in the future.

            <div class="studentInfo">
                I am a 22-year-old college graduating senior who is looking towards following a career in game design.  It is for this career 
                that I have worked towards getting a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and it was a large part of why I wanted to team 
                up for the Bot!Battle! project. It is my hope that this system will help foster a similar interest in Computer Science for 
                aspiring programmers, and I also hope that others interested in pursuing game design may learn from it as well.
